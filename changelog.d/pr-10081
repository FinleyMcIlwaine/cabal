synopsis: Remove the `CabalParsing`, `CharParsing`, and `Parsing` classes
packages: Cabal-syntax
prs: #10081
issues: #10080

description: {

- The `CabalParsing` class has been removed. All bindings which were previously
  overloaded in `CabalParsing` will have been specialized to `ParsecParser`.
- The `Distribution.Parsec.Parsec` class is renamed to
  `Distribution.Parsec.CabalParsec` to avoid ambiguity with
  `Text.Parsec.Parsec`.
- The `CharParsing` and `Parsing` classes and modules have been removed, and
  their methods are moved into `Distribution.Parsec`.

}
